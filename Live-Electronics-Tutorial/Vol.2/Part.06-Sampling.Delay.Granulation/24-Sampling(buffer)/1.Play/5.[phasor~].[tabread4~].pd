#X text 374 561 Interpolation can add noise artifacts. To reduce this
error you can work with files with higher sample rates than Pd is running
\, such as 88.2 KHz sound file when running at 44.1 Khz as in this
example., f 50;
#X text 374 636 You can use a good resampling software to upsample
a sound file as was done here for this example., f 50;

#X text 35 235 In this example we use [phasor~] to read from [tabread4~].
The [phasor~] object is used to play the sample in a loop \, and we
need to find the frequency corresponding to the sound file's period.
We do that by dividing the sample rate of the file (even if it's different
than Pd's) by the number of samples - both information are given by
[sample~] (one could use [soundfiler] instead \, in which [sample~]
is based on)., f 64;

#X text 515 74 We use a ratio value to set the speed \, this can also
be calculated from cents or a percentage value. Then \, all you need
is to multiply the ratio by the frequency in hertz. Note that negative
percentage/ratio values are possible and that they play the file backwards.
, f 57;
#X text 35 187 You can also play files with a different sample rate
than Pd is running \, because you can compensate the difference by
setting a difference speed., f 64;
#X text 35 34 The [tabplayer~] object from ELSE plays a buffer at different
speeds. In vanilla \, you need to read a buffer with [tabread4~] \,
which performs interpolation., f 64;
#X text 35 82 Because when you set a reading speed such as 1.5x (150%
faster) \, it means that the reading point will fall in between samples
every other sample \, thus you need to interpolate to get a value that
better corresponds to that missing step in between. We'll see the interpolation
type of [tabread4~] a bit later. By the way \, [tabplayer~] offers
the same interpolation type as [tabread4~]., f 64;
