#X text 27 26 Generally speaking \, modulating a signal means applying
any change to it. But in the context of computer music and synthesis
\, we're talking about a modulating signal that controls a parameter
\, such as the amplitude as we've seen. Let's check now the basic structure
of Frequency Modulation with an oscillator as the modulating signal.
;
#X text 27 122 The signal to be modulated is called the "Carrier" -
in the case of frequency modulation \, this can also be called "Carrier
Frequency". Conversely \, we also have a Modulator frequency \, which
is the frequency of the modulating oscillator. The frequency deviation
is controlled by the oscillator's amplitude and is also usually called
"modulation index". The modulation procedure is simple \, just add
the carrier signal to the modulating signal - see the example to the
right., f 59;
#X text 27 260 By default \, we have a 400 Hz carrier signal \, a low
frequency of 1 as the modulating frequency and an index of 100 - this
means the modulating signal oscillates between -100 and 100 at every
second \, and the resulting frequency modulating signal varies from
300 to 500 hz. Note that a low frequency modulator generates vibrato
like effects \, but try higher frequencies.;
