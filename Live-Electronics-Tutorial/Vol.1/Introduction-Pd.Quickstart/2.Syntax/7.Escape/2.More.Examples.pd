#X text 52 24 The backlash character is used in Pd to escape special
characters that are handled differently in Pd. Such characters are:
commas \, semicolons \, space and dollar signs (as we've seen in the
last example). Another such character is the backlash character itself.
Hence \, you can use backlashes in message boxes for these cases. For
instance \, below we create symbols with commas and spaces., f 66
;
#X text 42 510 This way \, the messages above get properly stored in
the text object \, which is an object that defines and manipulates
texts in Pd., f 53;

#X text 565 25 Note that if you type the messages "one symbol" and
"one \, symbol" in a symbol box \, you'll see it automatically generates
a preceding backlash character for the space and comma. This will also
happen for the other special characters (such as semicolons and dollar
signs)., f 68;
#X text 564 106 We've seen how this can be useful to set a receive
name in a GUI and save it as a literal '\$0' without expanding to the
patch ID number. In the next example we have to do things differently.
See below how the symbol to the left gets expanded when it comes out
of the [symbol] object \, whereas the one to the right does not.,
f 68;
#X text 570 453 Now let's understand that in order to match the [receive
\$0-x] object \, you cannot set it as a "symbol \\\$0-x" in a symbol
box. You actually need the expanded symbol that comes out of the object
[symbol \$0-x]., f 65;
#X text 570 519 Setting with the escaped "\\\$0-x" symbol can only
match an object with a literal "\\\$0-x" \, and it must be clear now
how it is not the same thing \, as [receive \\\$0-x] is not actually
loading the locality variable., f 65;
#X msg 198 382 list Hi \\\, how are you? \\\; Fine \\\, thanks! \\\;
;
#X text 52 252 Here's another example. Below we have a list where commas
and semicolons are escaped and therefore they are not treated as they
normally would. The comma does not separate the message and the semicolon
does not define a send address. Note \, however \, how the backslash
needs to be after a space \, so you end up with an item followed separately
by a comma or a semicolon \, otherwise it is treated as a single symbol
as the examples above., f 66;
