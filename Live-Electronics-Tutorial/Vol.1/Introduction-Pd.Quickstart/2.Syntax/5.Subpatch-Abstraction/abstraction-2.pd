#X text 240 183 This is an abstraction with "graph on parent". Right
click into an empty spot on the patch and choose "properties" as one
of the ways to access this option. Another way is right clicking on
the abstraction in the parent window. Note that this abstraction is
also set to hide its name and arguments in the parent patch.;
#X text 122 112 <===============;
#X text 248 85 Check the help file of [pdcontrol] object that offers
an alternative way to load arguments. This abstraction has an argument
of 17 as you can see on the top of the patch window. The advantage
is that this allows you to manage a variable number of arguments.,
